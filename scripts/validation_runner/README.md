# Temporary validation runner

This runs one **GitHub Actions job** inside the local, tested SFDE container. It is a temporary way to test public YouTube or Twitch recordings from a network where anonymous metadata/media access succeeds. YouTube uses the reviewed catalog path; Twitch requires an existing catalog entry and pending chunk plan. It does not install anything on the host, use provider cookies, change upstream clients, or move OCR into Cloudflare.

Only `liftaris/bazaar-ghost`, `migration/cloudflare`, `workflow_dispatch`, and `validate-recording.yml` pass the image-owned pre-job hook. The runner has one random label, no default labels, and unregisters after one job. Its container runs as UID 1000 with dropped capabilities, no Docker socket, no host filesystem mounts, no host home, and no host network mode. All runner credentials and checked-out files live in the disposable container layer. GitHub supplies only the validation environment's catalog/processor capabilities to the processing step; the OCR subprocess receives the processor key alone.

The runner is pinned to the official [v2.337.0 release](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.337.0), with the release's SHA-256 verified during build. Its registration token is read once from stdin and passed to the official runner as `ACTIONS_RUNNER_INPUT_TOKEN` only for configuration. It is never put in argv, a file, Docker configuration, or printed. The parent process does not pass that variable to the listening runner. See the official [runner argument reader](https://github.com/actions/runner/blob/v2.337.0/src/Runner.Listener/CommandSettings.cs), [ephemeral runner documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/self-hosted-runners#ephemeral-runners-for-autoscaling), and [job hook documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/run-scripts).

## Build and local checks

From the repository root:

```sh
docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=sfde:cloudflare-platform-test \
  -t bazaarghost-validation-runner:2.337.0 scripts/validation_runner
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p test_validation_runner.py
```

The initial built image is `sha256:a517898e645b6b1b5ee62857cecba354c0facdac2bd45dcc66d83a63e088a63c`, based on tested SFDE image `sha256:96a66467eeb001026541e5b0025ae081c9c499f1fee85cd2decfe806944b58c6`. Offline container checks confirmed UID 1000, GitHub runner 2.337.0, Deno 2.9.5, Python OCR imports and cached models. The workflow executes `sfde/src/sfde.py` from the exact dispatched checkout, so runtime packages/models come from the image while detector code and templates come from the reviewed commit.

## Observed dispatch

On 2026-09-07, GitHub accepted an actual manual dispatch of this feature-branch workflow: [run 34150684415](https://github.com/liftaris/bazaar-ghost/actions/runs/34150684415), at commit `823082a4ddab9d61a2f7bed81e09138665cdd98f` on `codex/cloudflare-validation`. Its `validate` job was assigned to the ephemeral runner `bazaarghost-validation-cee8c1f478e1465a8c222d352c18ac30`.

This establishes dispatch acceptance for this repository, branch and workflow after its registration push. Workflow inventory visibility alone was not used as proof. Dispatch acceptance and runner assignment do not establish successful OCR completion; the run's terminal result and validation artifacts provide that evidence.

## Operator steps

1. Commit and push these files to `migration/cloudflare`. Its path-scoped push trigger makes the workflow discoverable while deliberately skipping its sole job. Although GitHub [documents a default-branch requirement for manual dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/manually-run-a-workflow), this repository's feature-branch dispatch was actually accepted as recorded above. Confirm each real dispatch result rather than relying on inventory visibility; if a later dispatch is rejected, keep dev unchanged and review the entry point before proceeding. Ensure the validation Worker and migrations are deployed and its GitHub environment has `BAZAARGHOST_API_URL`, `BAZAARGHOST_CATALOG_KEY`, and `BAZAARGHOST_PROCESSOR_KEY`.
2. Review one public YouTube or Twitch video, its exact gameplay ranges, template era, resolution, and an existing validation crop profile. Ranges must be sorted/nonoverlapping, at most 1800 seconds each, at most twelve ranges and 21600 seconds (six hours) total. Split a longer continuous chapter into adjacent reviewed ranges. Use 480p for old templates. The profile must already exist; the runner has no admin key and cannot create profiles. For Twitch, first complete the real catalog acceptance and create its pending plan through the existing operator path. The runner reads `/api/processor/vod`; it requires an available, enabled, ready, pending VOD whose source ID, chapter coverage, effective profile and template era match the review. It cannot catalog Twitch, enable its streamer, create its plan, or override `recorded_at`.
3. Create a private task directory and input document. The example values below are placeholders for reviewed content; no secret belongs in this document:

```sh
mkdir -p .ignore/validation-runner
chmod 700 .ignore/validation-runner
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, pathlib, uuid
path = pathlib.Path('.ignore/validation-runner')
label = 'bazaarghost-validation-' + uuid.uuid4().hex
(path / 'label').write_text(label + '\n')
inputs = {'runner_label': label, 'source': 'youtube', 'video_id': 'REVIEWED_ID',
          'ranges': '[0,900]', 'templates': 'current', 'profile_id': '1',
          'quality': '480p', 'recorded_at': '', 'minimum_detections': '1', 'require_igd': 'true'}
(path / 'inputs.json').write_text(json.dumps(inputs))
PY
```

4. Start a single ephemeral runner. The registration response flows directly through stdin. Do not enable shell tracing. This terminal remains attached until the job ends:

```sh
VALIDATION_RUNNER_LABEL="$(cat .ignore/validation-runner/label)"
gh api --method POST repos/liftaris/bazaar-ghost/actions/runners/registration-token --jq .token \
  | python3 scripts/validation_runner/launch.py --label "$VALIDATION_RUNNER_LABEL"
```

5. Once it reports that it is awaiting the job, dispatch from a second terminal:

```sh
gh workflow run validate-recording.yml --repo liftaris/bazaar-ghost \
  --ref migration/cloudflare --json < .ignore/validation-runner/inputs.json
```

The launcher uses a disposable container with 4 CPUs, 12 GiB memory, 2 GiB shared memory and a 512-process limit. It never invokes sudo. Its image must already exist locally (`--pull=never`). A new recording/job requires a new random label and fresh ephemeral container.

The job timeout is 450 minutes: twelve sequential chunks have individual 2000-second timeouts (400 minutes combined), leaving 50 minutes for checkout, preparation, public/JPEG verification and artifacts. This is an upper bound, not a runtime estimate. GitHub permits self-hosted jobs beyond its default 360-minute job timeout; see [job timeout syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes) and [self-hosted execution limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/limits). No separate step timeout is set.

## What success proves

The single job verifies the backend's validation identity before sending capabilities, catalogs the reviewed YouTube video/ranges or verifies the existing Twitch catalog, resolves its media, and processes planned chunks sequentially. Twitch source metadata is checked again at completion; the artifact identifies that its catalog was reused, which does not establish discovery/catalog provenance. Missing Twitch metadata or chunks remain prerequisite failures. It refuses pre-existing completed/failed/queued work or a plan that does not exactly cover the reviewed ranges. To retry failed work, an operator must explicitly reset that validation VOD through the existing admin API before starting another runner; no state-reset authority is given to the runner.

Each OCR claim sends the prepared profile and template era. The Worker compares the profile ID, nameplate/IGD crops, custom edge, opacity and template selection atomically with the claim, so a stale preparation fails before clearing detections or reading media. An intentional crop change must be saved and selected in the catalog before preparing a new run; ad hoc `SFDE_PROFILE` overrides are no longer accepted. This applies to the regular `process-vod.yml` workflow too. Profile names and timestamps are descriptive metadata, not crop comparison fields.

For each chunk it requires completed backend state, the reviewed resolution, the exact expected frame count, and decoder timestamps covering the entire sampled timeline. A 900-second range requires 450 samples at two-second intervals, including the expected first and last timestamps. Prepared crop profile/template era must match the review; a resolution fallback is rejected before OCR. It compares persisted chunk detection counts with the OCR summary, checks every high-confidence detection's name/rank/day through the public API, and fully decodes every JPEG with Pillow, bounded to 5 MB and 16 million decoded pixels. The public detection set must exactly match the high-confidence OCR results, and the backend build must remain unchanged during the run. `require_igd=true` additionally requires at least one extracted day. The VOD must reach `completed`.

Artifacts contain `validation.json` plus the per-chunk OCR JSON reports for seven days. They record the checked-out commit, deployed Worker commit, precise ranges, full-source-video versus selected-range coverage, frame counts/timestamps, public detection totals, IGD totals and verified screenshot paths/dimensions. Adjacent reviewed ranges are merged when determining whether the entire source upload was covered. A completed selected range is explicitly distinguished from processing the entire source upload. Public results and screenshots still require human spot-checking for OCR accuracy; successful transport and persistence do not prove every reading is correct.

## Cleanup and limits

GitHub automatically deregisters a successfully assigned ephemeral runner after its one job; `docker run --rm` removes its container and credentials afterward. If cancelled before receiving a job, stop its container and remove the stale runner registration through the repository runner API. Verify names before deleting an entry:

```sh
docker stop --timeout 60 "$VALIDATION_RUNNER_LABEL"
gh api repos/liftaris/bazaar-ghost/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | {id,name,status,busy}'
# Only if the exact temporary runner remains:
gh api --method DELETE repos/liftaris/bazaar-ghost/actions/runners/REVIEWED_RUNNER_ID
```

The image and private task input files may be retained for another reviewed run. No host credentials are copied into either. This is a temporary validation path, not a deployed autoscaling service. A future GitHub runner release may require rebuilding the pinned image; GitHub can stop dispatching to sufficiently old runners. Building and testing the image does not register a runner or start a workflow; registration and dispatch are explicit operator steps.
